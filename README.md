## Proejct Outline

For my project I decided to make a simple piong game. The main idea of the pong game is for their to be a paddle that hits a ball, causing it do hit off in different directions. In addition to the graphical aspect of my project, which uses P5.js, I used Tone.js to import sounds and also using the arduino to control physical inputs as well as having information transmitted to the Arudino from P5

# Features
1. Paddle controleld by joystick. 
2. Dynamic Movement of the ball.
3. Timer. 
4. Score. 
5. Buzz when pong ball hits outer bounds. 
6. have a Tone sound whenver ball is hit. 


## Using the Arduino

The arduino Uno was used so that the pong paddle could be controlled by a joystick along with a buzzer that will sound if the pong ball hits the outer bounds. In order for the joystick to move the paddle I had to map the values recived from the arduino to p5 using the Map() function. In order to get the buzzer to work, I sent the word > buzzer < and passing a value used for how long the buzzer shoudl stay active.

# Schematic 
These two images give a detailed look at how my aurdino was set up to get the physical components working.

**## Further Development** 
Developing this project further, I think I would make it a multiplayer game.I would add anothe rpaddle controlled maybe by the keyboard arrows; and have players play against each other for a set amount of time.
